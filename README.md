This Python script implements a basic music player with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter and pygame.mixer libraries.

Here's a breakdown of its features and functionality:

Core Functionality: The player allows users to load, play, pause, and stop audio files.

Supported Formats: It supports common audio file formats such as MP3, WAV, and OGG.

User Interface:

It presents a simple window with buttons for "Play", "Pause", "Stop", and "Load".

A status label provides feedback on the player's current state (e.g., "Playing", "Paused", "Stopped", "No file loaded", or the name of the loaded file).

File Loading: Users can select an audio file from their system using a file dialog.

Playback Control:

The "Play" button initiates playback of the loaded file or resumes if paused.

The "Pause" button temporarily halts playback.

The "Stop" button completely stops the current playback.

Error Handling (Basic): It provides simple status messages for scenarios like no file being loaded or no music playing.

Dependencies: It relies on the pygame library (specifically mixer for audio playback) and tkinter for the GUI.

Object-Oriented Design: The music player's logic is encapsulated within a MusicPlayer class, making the code organised and modular.
